    <p>In this document, we will explore different ways to apply colors, units and sizes in CSS. By using the popular latin dummy text, Lorem Ipsum .</p>

    <h2 class="container">Applying colors</h2>
    <p class="container">There are three ways to apply color, one is by using the color options in VS. Next we can also type in the HEX code (eg #00000, black) of the colour and this can really help to widen the color choices as VS only hass 100+ options. lastly, we can use the RGB ratio, this can be use if we want to use different shades of blacks, just modify the ratio. As for black, the ratios all zero. Easiest is by clicking the color box and hover round the color hues provided by VS. Can also consider a contrast checker online to be really sure thats contrast score is at least 7.</p>

    <h2>Units in CSS</h2>
    <p>Units in CSS are used when expressing measured value such as width, margin font sizes, line height, etc. Some units for example as for width, vdw, it is better to use percentage in a lot of instances. Here are the list of common units used in CSS : </p>

    <ul>
        <li>em- font size pf parent</li>
       <li> ex- x-height of element font </li>
       <li> lh-line height </li>
       <li> vw - percentage view width </li>
       <li> vh- viewport height </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Boxes</h2>
    <p>As for boxes, use margin, padding, box sizing, border box to add. Margin can be used and can be specified either for left/right/top/bottom or in general.</p>
